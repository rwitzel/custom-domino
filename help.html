  <h5>How can I export the dominoes so that I can print them in high quality on cardboard?</h5>
  
  <p>Print to a PDF Writer like PDFCreator or CutePDF Writer. Then print the PDF in your copy shop.</p>

  <h5>Why can I not resize and crop images that are provided via URL?</h5>
  
  <p>Please first download the image to your disk and then upload it in the application. Then you can resize and crop.</p>
  
  <p>To answer your question: The current JavaScript security preferences do not allow modifications of images that
  are loaded from other domains. There are ways to deal with that but at the moment there are no plans to change the application.</p>
